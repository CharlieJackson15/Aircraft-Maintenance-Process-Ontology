# Aircraft-Maintenance-Process-Ontology
An ontology of aircraft maintenance processes for knowledge conceptualization and reuse
The ontology (AMPO) organizes and defines the concepts and semantic relationships, facilitating knowledge integration and representation in aircraft maintenance processes. 
The SWRL rules integrated into the file can be used to capture valuable knowledge for aircraft process knowledge reasoning.
